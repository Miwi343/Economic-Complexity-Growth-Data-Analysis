Research Question:
Is there a significant difference in economic complexity growth from 1995 to 2021 amongst countries with varying levels of public data transparency?

Purpose: 
The purpose of exploring my research question is to investigate if government transparency with public data can lead to more complex and robust economic conditions. In other words, Iâ€™m curious to see if there is a positive relationship between countries being open with their data and economic growth.
